Warning, you specified a working directory via "-w"
Keep in mind that RAxML only accepts absolute path names, not relative ones!

RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file



Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"

Alignment has 259 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 6.64%

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 2 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
Alignment Patterns: 259
Name: No Name Provided
DataType: DNA
Substitution Matrix: GTR
